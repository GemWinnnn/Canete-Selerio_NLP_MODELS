# NLP Tasks: Text Prediction and Sentiment Classification

This project implements text prediction and sentiment classification using both traditional machine learning and neural network approaches. The implementation uses the IMDB dataset for demonstration purposes.

## Model Architecture

### Text Prediction
- Traditional: Markov Chain model (2-gram based prediction)
- Neural Network: LSTM

### Sentiment Classification
- Traditional: Logistic Regression
- Neural Network: LSTM
